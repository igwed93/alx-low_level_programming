# 0x1C-makefiles

**Concepts Learned:**
- A makefile is a file that defines set of tasks to be executed. A Makefile sets a set of rules to determine which parts of a program needs to be recompiled, and issues commmand to recompile them.
- Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex tasks with dependencies.
- Makefile contains: dependency rules, macros and suffix (or implicit) rules.
- A rule is made up of a **target, prerequisite, and a recipe.**
- Makefiles are very useful when you want to update a task (or program). They are also handy when you have a large number of files to compile into a single executeable file.
- Explicit rules are instructions for specific files. Implicit rules are general instructions for files without eplicit rules.
- A variable is a name defined in a makefile to represent a string of text, called the variable's value. Variables are also called macros. They are usually substituted by explicit request into targets, prerequisites, commands, and other parts of the makefile.
